# <CAUTION>

This is a difficult programming assignment. 
Do not attempt to start it with less than 24 hours remaining.
Stop by office hours to talk through the hard parts (`infer` and `eval`).

This is a 2 part assignment. You have 2 weeks to complete part 1, part 2 will be pa6.

# Important Note:

In many code comments, I use the `NAME` format to denote that a variable or type 
**must have the exact name** for proper testing. If you do not use the same 
naming conventions, the autograder will not be able to run your code, and 
**you will receive 0 points on the submission**.

# Part 0: Familiarity and a bug fix

Stephen Diehl has put a lot of effort into building an educational interpreter
for a small language minML. ML is a language we didn't look at but will probably
appear quite familiar after working with Haskell.

For example, here are a few definitions (from [test.ml](test.ml)):

```ocaml
let x = 0;
let compose f g = \x -> f (g x);
let twice f x = f (f x);

let rec fib n = 
  if (n == 0) 
  then 0
  else if (n==1) 
  then 1
  else ((fib (n-1)) + (fib (n-2)));
```

Start by installing (`cabal install`) and running the code (`cabal run`) 
Play around in the interpreter.
What can you do? What can you not do? Are there any noticeable errors?

Read through some of the code (there actually isn't that much).
I would suggest reading the files in this order:

1. [Syntax.hs](src/Syntax.hs) - contains the legal syntax rules
2. [Type.hs](src/Type.hs) - defines the types
3. [Lexer.hs](src/Lexer.hs) - step 1 of running code is reading the tokens into the interpreter
4. [Parser.hs](src/Parser.hs) - step 2, convert tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (via Syntax.hs)
5. [Main.hs](src/Main.hs) - Check out the steps for reading a file and parsing it
6. [Eval.hs](src/Eval.hs) - Execute code according to the AST (quite simple!)
7. [Infer.hs](src/Infer.hs) - Perform HMTI on the AST
8. [Pretty.hs](src/Pretty.hs) - Define some pretty printing rules for Syntax and Type

## Fix:

While playing with the interpreter you might have noticed that there is a bug!

```ocaml
>>> let x = 3 + 2
Cannot unify types: 
        Int
with 
        Int -> a
```

```ocaml
>>> let x = 3
>>> let f y = x + y
Cannot unify types: 
        Int
with 
        Int -> a
```

Find the location of the error in the source code and make the fix:

```sh
grep -rn "TODO-0" src
```

# Part 1: Adding lists

Unfortunately the project is retired and the author has not completed all the features
that we would like from our language. In particular we cannot create lists! 
(Note: we actually can, using lambda calculus structures because LC is all powerful, see test.ml for examples.)

You task is to allow for native list creation, e.g.:

```ocaml
let w = [];                     -- empty lists
let x = [1, 2, 3];              -- lists with values in them
let y = True:[]                 -- Cons'ing 
let z = [1, 2] ++ [3, 4]         -- Concat'ing

let f x = [x, x]                -- lists that are parametric
let g x = [x, x * 2, x * 3]     -- lists that are specified
```

## Edits:

The code is annotated with TODOs to be filled in by you. 
Start by browsing the files to get a bit of familiarity with the project.
Then start tackling the TODOs in this order:
1. Lexer.hs
2. Syntax.hs
3. Parser.hs
4. Types.hs
5. Pretty.hs
6. Infer.hs (just add stubs)
7. Eval.hs
8. Infer.hs (finish stubs)

You can get a sense of the edits required by searching for the TODO-1's 
```sh
grep -rn "TODO-1" src
```

Ignore `TODO-2` sections, those are part of the next assignment!

## Debugging with print:

Part of this project will be getting familiar with debugging non-trivial code in Haskell.
One thing to look for is typical print line debugging.
You can achieve this in Main.hs, in the `exec` function.

Add statements such as:

```haskell
  liftIO $ putStrLn "Test" -- Print "Test" to console
  liftIO $ print source    -- Print the source argument
  
  -- Test parsing a custom string
  res <- hoistErr $ parseExpr "3 + 2"
  liftIO $ putStrLn $ ppexpr res

  -- Print the results of the parseMod call
  liftIO $ putStrLn ("Parsed: " ++ concatMap (\(x, y) -> show x ++ " := " ++ ppexpr y ++ "\n") mod)
```

# Debugging with Trace

Tracing execution is tricky in a language which values purity.
The Trace monad can help.

First import trace
```haskell
import Debug.Trace
```

Then, in your `do` block, simply chain the trace call to your existing execution block

```haskell
-- before
eval env expr = do
  case expr of
    ...

-- after
eval env expr = do
  trace ("Log: " ++ show expr) do
    case expr of
      ...
```
